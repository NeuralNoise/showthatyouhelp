<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong>
    When you create or reconfigure a showthatyouhelp.com account, you provide some personal information,
    such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example,
    your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and
    in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not
    require registration.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong>
    You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short paragraph about yourself,
    your website, or a picture. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services.
    You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from notifications from showthayouhelp.com. You may also
    unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification. We may use your
    contact information to help others find your account, including through third-party services.
    If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to
    your request. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>

<p><strong>Updates, Lists and other Public Information:</strong>
    Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the
    information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not
    only the comments you share and the metadata provided with Updates, but also the lists you create,
    the people you receive updates from, the Updates you comment, and many other bits of information
    that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information
    you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from showthatyouhelp.com.
    <?php //, but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want ?>
    Your public information is
    broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public
    Updates may be searchable by search engines. When you share information or content like photos,
    videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
